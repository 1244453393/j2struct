# j2struct
use java to parse the binary struct of "C/C++"
# example
if you have a gay colleague, he is the R&D position of "C/C++", because of some businesses, he wrote binary files using structure.

view the following c/c++ code

you need to read this binary file, but you ony know "java" language.

you: "oh, my God, what should I do"

don't worry, j2struct helps you. XDDDDDDDDDD

view the following java code

is it very cool?

It may also be very backward! XDDDDDDD
# more
j2struct can not only read struct binary, but also write struct binary!

j2struct supports all basic types
